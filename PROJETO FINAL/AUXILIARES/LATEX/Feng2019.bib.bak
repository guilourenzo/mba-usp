abstract = {The development of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) has achieved a lot of fruitful results so far, and we know that activation function is one of the principal factors which will affect the performance of the networks. In this work, the role of many different types of activation functions, as well as their respective advantages and disadvantages and applicable fields are discussed, so people can choose the appropriate activation functions to get the superior performance of ANNs.},
