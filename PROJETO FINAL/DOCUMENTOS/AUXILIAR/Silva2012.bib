abstract = {Machine learning is evidenced as a research area with the main purpose of develop- ing computational methods that are capable of learning with their previously acquired experiences. Although a large amount of machine learning techniques has been pro- posed and successfully applied in real systems, there are still many challenging is- sues, which need be addressed. In the last years, an increasing interest in techniques based on complex networks (large-scale graphs with nontrivial connection patterns) has been verified. This emergence is explained by the inherent advantages provided by the complex network representation, which is able to capture the spatial, topological and functional relations of the data. In this work, we investigate the new features and possible advantages offered by complex networks in the machine learning domain. In fact, we do show that the network-based approach really brings interesting features for supervised, semisupervised, and unsupervised learning. Specifically, we reformu- late a previously proposed particle competition technique for both unsupervised and semisupervised learning using a stochastic nonlinear dynamical system. Moreover, an analytical analysis is supplied, which enables one to predict the behavior of the proposed technique. In addition to that, data reliability issues are explored in semisu- pervised learning. Such matter has practical importance and is found to be of little investigation in the literature. With the goal of validating these techniques for solving real problems, simulations on broadly accepted databases are conducted. Still in this work, we propose a hybrid supervised classification technique that combines both low and high orders of learning. The low level term can be implemented by any classifi- cation technique, while the high level term is realized by the extraction of features of the underlying network constructed from the input data. Thus, the former classifies the test instances by their physical features, while the latter measures the compliance of the test instances with the pattern formation of the data. Our study shows that the proposed technique not only can realize classification according to the semantic mean- ing of the data, but also is able to improve the performance of traditional classification techniques. Finally, it is expected that this study will contribute, in a relevant manner, to the machine learning area.},
