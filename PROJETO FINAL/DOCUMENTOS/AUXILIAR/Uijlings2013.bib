abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of generating possible object locations for use in object recognition. We introduce selective search which combines the strength of both an exhaustive search and segmentation. Like segmentation, we use the image structure to guide our sampling process. Like exhaustive search, we aim to capture all possible object locations. Instead of a single technique to generate possible object locations, we diversify our search and use a variety of complementary image partitionings to deal with as many image conditions as possible. Our selective search results in a small set of data-driven, class-independent, high quality locations, yielding 99 {\%} recall and a Mean Average Best Overlap of 0.879 at 10,097 locations. The reduced number of locations compared to an exhaustive search enables the use of stronger machine learning techniques and stronger appearance models for object recognition. In this paper we show that our selective search enables the use of the powerful Bag-of-Words model for recognition. The selective search software is made publicly available (Software: http://disi.unitn.it/{\蹰觎轭珞渝戾泗轹逵遽蜚璁梏盱┊荇屮翥镳蜷玷酏舶背羽蜷铉弪鱼殄钽瀚迈箝铄篌湾溟五亠螂狨翳矧臻觎轭珞十耶耶犷轴腻俞钿妪水女廉犷清鲥蝮犷禹艴熹弪蟋廉桩彤滹卑卑胺蟊辈冻氨抄岸舶谍骈戾好ぼ忉汶箪狍瑜函阵弪蟑珲殪锆琉鹉狒岑田汜殳湾钿屐妁挑洚湾钿屐妁腻箅麸鸠娘黝祜徜邃臻觎轭珞弭犰舶背渝戾泗轹渝狎汨骘镶赍泗义泔珙轸轱町痄婧痄纨轶箢肮舶刀贡觑躜钺深舢十蔑眇豸珠螽脲黠蜾ī铛礅弪昌疳珏钡喘狈饼糸綮渝戾泗轹箦狎汨骘镡赍泗蝈泔珙轸轱铨躜梏麴蠛滹楫矧绡卑卑胺蟊辈冻氨抄岸舶梏麴函溟箝躅轸町轸uijlings/SelectiveSearch.html},
